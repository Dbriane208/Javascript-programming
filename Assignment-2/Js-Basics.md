# 1. Data Types and Variables
- JavaScript uses data types like <b>numbers, strings, booleans, objects,BigInt,Arrays,Symbol undefined,</b> and <b>null.</b>
- <b>var</b> allows re-declaration, <b>let</b> allows re-assignment but is block-scoped, and <b>const</b> is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned.

- JavaScript allows assigning different data types to same variable because it is dynamically typed, so a variable can hold different types due to its flexible nature.
- Uninitialized variables have the value undefined.
- Variable names help identify and store values. Descriptive names improve readability and maintainability.

# 2. Numeric Data Types
- JavaScript uses <b>numbers, including integers, floats,</b> and <b>Infinity.</b>
- Integers are whole numbers, doubles and floats are numbers with decimals, and Infinity represents a number larger than the maximum numeric value.
- JavaScript automatically handles arithmetic operations, converting data types as needed.

# 3. String Data Types
- Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes.
- Strings can be declared with <b>single (')</b> or <b>double (")</b> quotes. Both work similarly, but consistency is preferred.
- Characters are automatically treated as strings because there is no separate character type in JavaScript.

# 4. Boolean and Undefined Data Types
- Boolean variables hold either true or false, typically used in conditions.
- Undefined means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value. 
- Boolean variables are crucial for control flow, helping evaluate conditions in if statements.

# 5. Null Data Types
- null represents the intentional absence of any object value.
- null is an assigned value, while undefined means a variable has no value. 
- null can be used to indicate no value, like resetting a variable.

# 6. Object Data Types
- Objects are collections of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces {}.
- Objects can contain other objects as properties, enabling complex data structures

# 7. Array Data Types
- Arrays are ordered lists of values, useful for storing multiple related items.
- An array can contain various types.
- "Array of arrays" refers to nested arrays, useful for multi-dimensional data, like matrices.

# 8. Variable Naming conventions
- Variable names should use camelCase and start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign.
- Meaningful names make code easier to understand and maintain.

# 9. Constants in JavaScript
- const is used to declare variables whose values cannot be reassigned.
- Reassigning a const variable throws an error since constants are immutable.
